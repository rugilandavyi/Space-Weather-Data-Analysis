# Space-Weather-Data-Analysis
This project analyses space wether data of solar wind parameters and geomagnetic parameters, it establishes to observe the statistical relationships between all these parameters and highlights their behaviour during major space weather events such as solar flares and corona mass ejections that may subsequently result to geomagnetic storms.
